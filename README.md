Dear player,

This is Mindcraft. Please allow me to introduce myself. We are a non-profit organization aiming to help those in emotional need with customized company while playing Minecraft. We hope to use the game to help them with expressing their attitudes, being more comfortable with themselves, and having a meaningful time overall. If you want, feel free to play with us! We have a custom-made server, with software support available via a custom-made web-app. 
We are verified students at Caltech. But please note that we aren't professional therapists. We don't ask you to treat us like professionals, we learn and grow with you. We all have passion for playing Minecraft, so don't worry, you are not burdening us with extra work, you are in fact helping us - balancing our life with meaningful interactions and wonderful play time. 
So if you want, reach out! The email we handle communications is: elinalin@caltech.edu
We hope to hear from you, but only if you want to hear from us again.


Best,

Mindcraft @ Caltech
